It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles. It gets activated and receives the signal as the vehicles passes close by it.EXPERIENCE:                                          I am carrying an experience of  2 years  from MetroLabs Services Pvt Ltd.

It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles. It gets activated and receives the signal as the vehicles passes close by it.EXPERIENCE:I am carrying an experience of  2 years  from MetroLabs Services Pvt Ltd.ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES :Over 2 years of extensive experience as a Front End Developer with solid understanding of website and application designing, development of different modules using ReactJS.Professional understanding of Software development life cycle (SDLC) as well as various phases such as Analysis Design, Development and Testing.
